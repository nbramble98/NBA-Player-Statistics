-- INST326 Project
-- December 10, 2019

The name of the program we created is called 'NBA-Player-Statistics', and uses statistics from the 2017-2018 NBA season. The script for the code can be found in a file within the repository called, '326 final project.ipynb'. It's purpose is to determine if the number of minutes played by individual players has an impact on how many points they scored. We imported several packages (including the pandas, seaborn, scipy and statsmodels package) in order to perform t-test analysis and linear regression analysis; and display a histogram, scatterplot, linear regression plot, and descriptive statistics chart to show the correlation between the two variables. 

The data for the code can be found in a file within the repository called 'NBA players data final project.xlsx', or can be accessed at https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2018_per_game.html
